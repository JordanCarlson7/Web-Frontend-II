What did I do since the last meeting?
I did some more reading and tried to figure out more about
callback functions and looked into how to make my portfolio nicer

What am I going to do next?
Read some more and make my portfolio more accessible for the teacher

What are my blockers?
I need to be a team player and not get carried away with
my own ideas. Balance work load and opportunites for others to share
