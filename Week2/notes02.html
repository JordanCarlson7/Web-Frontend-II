            Chapter 1 Week02 Notes
            Chapter 2: Programming Basics
            Symbols are unique IDs for variables
            Non-primitive objects share values by reference, if a and b both equal non-primitive object c, then anytime sometime is edited in a,b, or c will result in a change to all objects because they are references to the same object. Pointers.
            Chapter 3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops
                Deleting an item in an array makes the item at that index undefined and the memory at that index is still allocated.
                Numbers are Sorted Alphabetically? Why?
                WeakSet() will will garbage collect andy dead object references. 
                    Only add non-primitive data types to WeakSets
                Ternary operator ?
                    Condtional statement ? True outcome : false outcome;
            Chapter 4: Functions
                Computers have rounding errors when trying to divide anything other than 2 due to base 2 binary system
                Arguments variable contains an array of all the arguments passed to a function
                **for group project, look at Improved Mean Function using the rest (â€¦) operator to contain all variables into an array
                Default value, declare value in parameter 
                function square(x){        === const square = x => x*x;
                    return x*x;
                }
            const square = x => x*x;
            Both of these functions are the same.
            Hoisting will take a declaration and place it at the top of the scope but not move the assignment of the variable. VAR is a always hoisted. LET or CONST are not
            Function callbacks, you can send a function as a parameter to a function
                Can be used to specify how you want a particular function to act, sorting numbers for example, how do you want them to be sorted? Write a callback function to your sort method.
                ${i} gets a string literal of i
            Chaining Iterators
                You can chain functions and callbacks together just use . operator and method call after
            Callbacks can be used to adjust or edit the functionality of any function so they can be readily used for multiple situations
