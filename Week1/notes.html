            <li>UX improvements</li>
            <li>People don’t know what they want until you show it to them, observe what they do not what they say</li>
            <li>Give them what they came for quickly, make them think less. Smooth and seamless.</li>
            <li>Reachability, don’t make it hard</li>
            <li>Reduce heavy size data, photos and fonts</li>
            <li>Minify the documents to reduce loading times</li>
            <li>With software we just “make do”</li>
            <li>Make the bottom of the app the part that is most accessible by the fingers</li>
            <li>People use them easier and like them more and think the app itself moves faster</li>
            <li>Make buttons look like buttons</li>
            <li>Give the user what they want right off the bat</li>
            <li>Mobile Inputs (Forms)</li>
            <li>Mobile forces simplicity, lessen the cognitive load</li>
            <li>Demand less information so they don’t have to scroll or add unnecessary information</li>
            <li>Don’t cram info</li>
            <li>Give the user feedback, let them know how their progress is going</li>
            <li>Use autofill</li>
            <li>Just make it easy</li>
            <li>Make advertising better</li>
            <li>Parallax ads are good</li>
            <li>Advertise sparingly, content comes first</li>
            <li>Don’t inconvenience the user. Nobody really likes ads</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>Doing Stuff with Internet Things </h1>
            <ul>
                <li>localStorage is an object that contains local Storage</li>
                <li>localStorage.getItem(variable).</li>
                <li>localStorage.setItem(key, value).</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Questions</h1>
            <ul>Questions: Local storage saves info between refreshes and visiting other sites. Is that info ONLY stored in the browsers cache or is it also stored externally (local hard drive or server)?</ul>
