    <h2>Browser Object Model</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>DEFINITION: The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that
            contain information about the browser and computer screen. For example, we can find out which browser is
            being used to view a page (though, this method is unreliable). We can also find out the dimensions of the
            screen it is viewed on, and which pages have been visited before the current page. It can also be used for
            the rather dubious practice of creating pop-up windows, if you’re into annoying your users.</li>
        <li>
            WINDOW OBJECT: These properties and methods are made available through the window object. Every browser
            window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.
        </li>
        <li>Global variables: Created without variable keywords (let, var, const)</li>
        <li>window.alert, confirm, prompt bring up dialog boxes</li>
        <li>window.navigator then use .userAgent is the browser info</li>
        <li>LOCATION: The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current
            page. It contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL.</li>
        <li>.href or .protocol .host .hostname .pathname .search .port .hash .origin</li>
        <li>window.history to see history .go is to move through the history deque 1 0 or -1</li>
        <li>Window.open(URL) will open a new window</li>
        <li><code>const popup = window.open('https://sitepoint.com','
                SitePoint','width=400,height=400,resizable=yes');
                </code></li>
        <li>window.screen</li>
        <li>The Screen object has more uses for mobile devices. It also allows you to do things like turn off the
            device’s screen, detect a change in its orientation or lock it in a specific orientation.</li>
        <li>document.write('') will add text or elements to page</li>
        <li>COOKIES: Cookies can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience, storing user preferences,
            keeping track of user choices (such as a shopping cart), authentication and tracking users. The use of
            cookies for tracking purposes has been much maligned in recent years. Their use for data storage is starting
            to be replaced in many cases by the new HTML5 localStorage API as it allows more data to be stored. This is
            covered in Chapter 14. Cookies are still useful for retaining state information (such as if a user is logged
            in) because they’re passed between the client and server on every HTTP request.</li>
        <li>cookies use name=value pairs</li>
        <li>document.cookie</li>
        <li><code>const cookies = document.cookie.split("; ");<br>
                for (crumb of cookies){<br>
                    const [key,value] = crumb.split("=");<br>
                    console.log(`The value of ${key} is ${value}`);<br>
                }<br>
                </code></li>
        <li>cookies have an expiration date that you can change but don't rely on it</li>
        <li>HTTPS add 'secure' to end of cookie string to allow it only to be transmitted over HTTPS</li>
        <li>Deleting cookies occurs by setting the exipration date to be in the past</li>
        <li>window.setTimeout(function, time in milliseconds)</li>
        <li>clearTimeOut will clear it</li>
        <li>setInterval() will make something happen every amount of time has passed (function, time)</li>
        <li>clearInterval() stops it</li>
        <li>bind this to a local that variabel</li>
        <li>GLOBAL SCOPE IS THE WINDOW OBJECT, METHODS OF WINDOW OBJECT IN GLOBLE SCOPE DON'T USE window.function THEY
            JUST USE function</li>
        <li> all of these functions return an <code>id</code> which can then be sent in the cancelation functions
            parameter to know which thing to cancel</li>
        <li><code>requestAnimationFram()</code> takes a callback function as to how to animate, cannot set frame rate
        </li>
        <li>Depending on what you need to do, CSS is quicker and easier for animations (less processing than Javascript)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>HTML5 APIs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Start with data- .

            Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.

            Include an optional string value.</li>
        <li>const superman = document.getElementById('hero');
            const powers = superman.dataset.powers;</li>
        <li>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device</li>
        <li>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere);</li>
        <ul>
            <li> position.speed property returns the ground speed of the device in meters per second.</li>

            <li>position.altitude property returns an estimate of the device’s altitude in meters above
                theWGS84ellipsoid, which is a standard measurement for the center of the Earth.</li>

            <li>position.heading property returns the direction the device is moving in. This is measured as a bearing
                in degrees, clockwise from North.</li>

            <li></li>position.timestamp property returns the time that the position information was recorded</li>
        </ul>
        <li>const worker = new Worker('task.js'); use theses to run major background processes, an entire js file</li>
        <li>Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server – also known as push messaging.
            This means that a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are
            received.</li>

            <li><code>const URL = 'wss://echo.websocket.org/';
                const outputDiv = document.getElementById('output');
                const form = document.forms[0];
                const connection = new WebSocket(URL);</code></li>
    </ul>
